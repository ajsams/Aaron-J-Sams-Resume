# Personal website and resume built with React + Vite

As a learning project, I rebuilt my personal website (previously built with just HTML/CSS) with React.

Although React is largely "overkill" for such a small website, I wanted to get experience with building components and better understand how React works.

## Deploying to Github Pages

I use the gh-pages node module to deploy to github pages.

## React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
