      "I studied abroad briefly in Classics, and it changed my life. A newfound fascination with- and appreciation for- human culture led me to pursue studies in Anthropology. This was my first major career pivot. Studying Anthropology taught me to both appreciate the value of data and science, but also to better understand that everything we do, including science, is filtered through- and influenced by- our social and cultural circumstances.\n\nI looked hard for Connor MacLeod here but couldn't find him.",

      "Ultimately, I began my graduate studies in paleoanthropology, and in my second big pivot eventually completed a dissertation in anthropological genomics as a graduate student at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Here, I taught myself to program (Python), developed a love of Resampling statistics, and learned how to tell a story with my work. I never had first access to data, so I also developed a knack for asking less than obvious questions of data.\n\nThis is my only photo with a celebrity.",

I spent over seven years at Embark, doing research, building data pipelines, and leading teams to build useful products for dog owners, breeders, and veterinarians. At Embark I learned how businesses scale and grow, and how apply my scientific and technical skills to problems that are relevant to the business.\n\nThis was the first and I suspect only time my face will ever be on the Jumbotron and Madison Square Garden...",

I'm working on my next thing, likely to be another big pivot.\n\nStay tuned...",
