    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>
      I am a science and technology generalist that loves to build and scale
      scientific software (Python is my primary language). My experience
      includes hands on data science as well as leading data science teams. I
      have experience leading cross functional data product teams in PetTech and
      BioTech. This experience includes leading teams that built and managed
      data platforms and machine-learning prediction pipelines with automated
      delivery and monitoring.
    </p>
    <p>
      Outside of my work in data science, I am working in video game development
      and building my full-stack web development skills.
    </p>
    <p>I'm currently open to two types of opportunities:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Data science consulting - If you have pressing questions about your
        customers and/or existing data that you believe can be answered, but you
        don't have internal resources to answer those questions, I can help you
        generate insights from your existing data and help gather data from
        outside your organization.
      </li>
      <li>
        Corporate video game development - My game studio is open to contract
        opportunities to develop games for your business. Games can serve as
        powerful tools for communicating your brand message, building loyalty,
        or educating both your customers and employees. We are currently
        building proof points and are looking for early partners to build our
        business.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Education</h2>
    <h3>University of Wisconsin-Madison</h3>
    <h4>Doctor of Philosophy, Anthropology (2012)</h4>
    <p>
      For my
      <a href="https://search.library.wisc.edu/digital/AQPMILF44JC5MM8H"
        >PhD thesis</a
      >
      I conducted research on the evolution of genes underlying risk for Celiac
      Disease to test the hypothesis that past selection on the immune system is
      responsible for increasing incidence of auto-immune disease today.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this work I developed custom compute infrastructure using python and
      integrated data from the 1000 Genomes Project and emergent ancient and
      archaic DNA.
    </p>

    <h4>Master of Science, Anthropology (2010)</h4>
    <p>
      Completed two years of coursework culminating in a rigorous two-day (16
      hour) written qualifying examination covering the breadth of the field of
      Biological Anthropology.
    </p>

    <h3>The University of Tennessee</h3>
    <h4>Bachelor of Arts, Anthropology - Honors Concentration</h4>
    <p>
      I graduated Summa Cum Laude with a degree in anthropology. I began college
      in the School of Music as a Vocal Performance major and continued to
      participate in the UT Chamber Singers and UT Opera as extracurricular
      activities after transitioning to the Department of Anthropology.
    </p>
    <p>
      In my undergraduate honors
      <a
        href="https://trace.tennessee.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2230&context=utk_chanhonoproj"
        >thesis</a
      >
      I conducted a comparative anatomical study of the supralaryngeal vocal
      tract in modern humans, neandertals, and chimpanzees to assess hypotheses
      about the capacity for modern speech in neandertals.
